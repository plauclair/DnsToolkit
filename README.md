# DNS Toolkit module documentation

DNS Toolkit is a ProcessWire module that gives easy access to DNS checking functions, including Spamhaus checker.

To use its functions, use either `$dns->function()` or `wire("dns")->function()`.

DNS Toolkit requires PHPâ€™s Intl  extension as it converts international domain names to ascii, which would otherwise give errors. 

## Available functions

### $dns->isValidHost($host, $type)

Checks if a domain IP has a DNS record for a record type. Can be fed an email address to check if its domain is valid.

#### Parameters

string $host : Any string, but should be a host name, IP or email to get valid results.
string $type : Valid values are MX (default), A, NS, SOA, PTR, CNAME, AAAA, A6, SRV, NAPTR, TXT, ANY.

#### Returns

True if the host is valid, false if not.

### $dns->isSpam($string)

Checks if a domain or IP is in the Spamhaus database. Make sure your server can resolve the host, some DNS like the Google Public DNS server might not resolve to Spamhaus, giving erroneous results.

#### Parameters

string $string : Can take any string, but preferably an URL, an email address, a host or IP. The host in those don't need to be valid, the function will take care of making sure it is.

#### Returns

True if the host is Spamhaus listed.
False if it's not.
Null if the host is invalid.
